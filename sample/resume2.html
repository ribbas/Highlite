Projects
    Kindrone
    Dragon Hacks @ Drexel University, Third Place Hack
           We developed a program that used the Kinect sensors to communicate with an AR.Drone.
           The Kinect was then hooked up to send commands to the AR.Drone by the use of hand gestures
           We set out with the goal of advancing existing forms of quadrotor control
    Team: Ammar Al-Kahfah, Jaime Orellana
    Tools: KinectSDK, AR.DroneSDK, C#, VisualBasic

    Major Way
    Hoya Hacks @ Georgetown University, Best Education Hack
           We created a website application that takes in an uploaded four-year major curriculum and returns
           a graph of the most relevant subtopics in the major.
           Our goal was to provide STEM students a service that outlines their major's subject composition so
           that they would be better informed about it.
    Team: Sabbir Ahmed, Justin Chavez, Ana Ortez-Rivera, Jaime Orellana
    Tools: Python, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Jquery, Flask and Natural Language Processing
