Data Science FellowData Science Fellow - Insight Data ScienceMadison, WI-Work ExperienceData Science FellowInsight Data Science - Palo Alto, CA-June 2016 to Present• Developed a user-friendly email sorting system for startup LeadGenius to automate the detection of buying signal from unread emails. • Performed supervised learning based on 60,000 labeled emails using doc2vec word embedding model and ensemble method, which combines the predictions from Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM. • Classified emails into four types based on "readiness to buy", at 90% accuracy rate. In particular, successfully identified "priority" emails, which represent only ~10% of total emails, at 97% recall rate. • Algorithm has been implemented by LeadGenius to replace their manual sorting.Research AssistantUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison - Madison, WI-August 2010 to Present• Applied statistical modeling and time-course analysis to study how the brain encodes multiple visual stimuli. • Built machine learning classifier (e.g. SVM and neural net) to decode external visual stimuli from neuron population activity. • Engineered features of medical record collected from a global health study conducted in Nigeria; built a logistic regression model to predict the incidence of stroke and identify major illness contributors. • Assisted advisor in grant application; mentored 8 students on fundamental research techniques and scientific communication.Energy Sustainability Consultant (co-op)Baxter Healthcare Corporation - Chicago, IL-January 2016 to May 2016• Developed a neural net model to estimate the marginal health cost associated with fossil fuel consumption to guide Baxter's investment in energy efficiency technology and clean energy. • Extracted and aggregated historical air quality and weather data, electricity load and traffic volume data from four federal agency databases to create a clean dataset for analysis. • Engineered features and built a neural net to estimate air pollution caused by electricity & vehicle usage. • Calculated the associated health cost (e.g. xx ¢/kWh and xx ¢/mile) and proposed implementation strategy.EducationPh.D. in NeuroscienceUniversity of Wisconsin - Madison, WIDecember 2016Ph.D. in EnergyUniversity of Science & Technology of China2010Linkshttp://bit.ly/2cfPf8JAdditional InformationSKILLS Languages: Python, R, Matlab, PostgreSQL, VBA          Tools: Scikit-Learn, IPython, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Flask etc.
