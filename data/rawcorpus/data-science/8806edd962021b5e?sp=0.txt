Data Science FellowFellow at Insight Data SciencePasadena, CA-Current Insight Data Science Fellow. I completed my PhD in Psychology (Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience) at The University of Chicago and then worked as a Postdoc at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences in Trento, Italy.   I have applied expertise in statistical methods, data science, data analysis, network science, modeling, creative problem-solving, as well as written and oral communication for diverse audiences.Authorized to work in the US for any employerWork ExperienceData Science FellowInsight Data Science-May 2017 to Present• Built web app to provide feedback and likelihood of a Twitter message’s (“tweet”) popularity • Scraped 500,000+ tweets by interfacing the Twitter API and Python • Designed PostgreSQL schema and created database to store and query tweets and user information • Performed natural language processing on tweets and used a random forest classifier to determine importance of features and likelihood of being shared • Developed interactive front end with Flask, Bootstrap, and Amazon Web ServicesPostdoctoral Research AssociateCenter for Mind/Brain Sciences, The University of Trento - Trento-July 2012 to July 2016• Developed graph-based network analyses that showed changes in topological organization of brain imaging data collected over repeated viewings of movies • Created Python and Matlab code to determine community structure repartitioning using modularity optimization over 19 networks of 10,000+ nodes, showing that brain areas central to language processing change temporal activation profiles in a state-dependent manner • Generated visualizations with ggplot in R to plot multivariate dependencies in brain signals across conditions, as well as linear relationships across participants • Depicted nonparametric distributions of sub-graph features between networks, degree distributions, and heat maps showing cross-correlation similarity using pyplot in Python • Wrote publications on context-dependent networks and book chapter on brain imaging methodsEducationPh.D. in Psychology (Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience)The University of Chicago - Chicago, IL2011B.A. in PsychologyUniversity of California - Santa Cruz, CA2003SkillsPython (10+ years), R (10+ years), SQL (4 years), Matlab, Written Communication, Technical Writing, Research (10+ years), Excel, Data Analysis, Databases, Data Science, Statistics (10+ years), Machine Learning
