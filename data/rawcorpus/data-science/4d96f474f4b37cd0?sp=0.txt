Data Science StudentData Science Student-Data Scientist with experience in data munging, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning. Former engineer passionate about finding solutions through data.Work ExperienceData Science StudentGeneral Assembly-April 2017 to July 201712-week accelerated immersive data science program learning tools and techniques needed to make better decisions through data, logging over 2000+ hours of instruction and coding. Performed 5 real-life applicable projects including: - Shoe Game  (Visualizations done in Tableau) Gathered data by scraping the web for collectible sneaker prices to discover if certain shoe properties can predict shoe rarity. Performed NLP to determine that shoe categories are associated with rarity. Used neural networks to create a model that can predict shoe rarity with 71% accuracy using only the images of the shoe. - RenovateAmes Predicted sales price of homes based on fixed features like square footage and neighborhood against dynamic features like finish of basement using Python's Scikit Learn library. Obtained a model that can predict 80% of sale prices' variability through linear regression, lasso regularization, and feature selection.Chemical Engineer IILG Hausys-2012 to 2016- Researched and developed new product lines with new procedures and technologies - Improved yield of worst-performing product series by 11% and saved $314K per year through Six Sigma project - Collaborated with purchasing, design, quality, maintenance, and marketing teams, along with outside contractors for 3-4 yearly product certifications - Collected, analyzed, and presented data using SAP & Excel for monthly reports on inventory, sales, and costsEducationBachelor of Science in Chemical & Biomolecular EngineeringGeorgia Institute of Technology - Atlanta, GA2011SkillsEXCEL (5 years), SAP (5 years), Git (Less than 1 year), MINITAB (Less than 1 year), NEURAL NETWORK (Less than 1 year)Linkshttp://github.com/chrisk447http://linkedin.com/in/christopherkim04Additional InformationTECHNICAL SKILLS Model Prediction: regression, feature selection/extraction, principal component analysis (PCA), ensembling, neural network, natural language processing (NLP), classification Programming Languages: Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn), SQL, Unix, Git Software: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Excel, Minitab, SAP
